# RTL Depth Predictor Algorithm Submission

## Project Overview

This project implements an enhanced RTL (Register Transfer Level) depth predictor that can accurately estimate the combinational path depth of signal paths in digital circuit designs described in RTL code. The algorithm uses machine learning techniques to analyze various features of RTL code and predict the gate-level depth without requiring full synthesis, significantly speeding up the design analysis process.

## Approach

### Problem Statement

Accurately predicting the combinational depth of a signal path in RTL code is crucial for timing analysis and optimization of digital circuits. Traditional methods require full synthesis which is time-consuming. Our approach enables quick estimation before synthesis.

### Algorithm Development Approach

The algorithm employs a comprehensive feature extraction and machine learning approach:

1. **Feature Engineering**: We extract multiple categories of features from RTL code:
   - Basic logic operators (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, buffer)
   - Control flow constructs (if-else, case statements)
   - Arithmetic operations (addition, multiplication, shifts)
   - Graph-based dependency metrics
   - Structural RTL features

2. **Dependency Graph Analysis**: We construct a directed graph representing signal dependencies, where:
   - Nodes represent signals
   - Edges represent dependencies with weights based on expression complexity
   - Graph metrics (centrality, path length, etc.) are extracted as features

3. **Model Selection**: We support multiple prediction models:
   - Random Forest Regressor (default)
   - Gradient Boosting Regressor
   - Neural Network (MLP)
   - Deep Neural Network (PyTorch)

4. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Grid search is used to find optimal model parameters

5. **Ensemble Learning**: Tree-based models provide feature importance analysis

### Key Innovations

- Weighted dependency graph that accounts for expression complexity
- Comprehensive feature extraction covering multiple aspects of RTL design
- Support for multiple ML models allowing selection based on dataset characteristics
- Integration of deep learning with PyTorch for complex patterns

## Proof of Correctness

### Theoretical Foundation

The correctness of our algorithm is based on the following principles:

1. **Feature Relevance**: RTL constructs have a direct impact on combinational path depth. For example:
   - More logic operators typically increase depth
   - Complex control structures add depth through multiplexing
   - Dependency chains correlate with longer paths

2. **Graph Theory**: The longest path in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representation of signal dependencies corresponds to the critical path in the circuit.

3. **Statistical Validation**: Our model evaluation includes:
   - Cross-validation to ensure robustness
   - Error analysis showing the distribution of prediction errors
   - Metrics for within-gate accuracy (% of predictions within 1-2 gates of actual)

### Validation Methodology

1. **Ground Truth Establishment**: Actual depths from synthesized circuits are used as the ground truth.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: 
   - The algorithm handles circuits with no combinational logic
   - It detects and warns about unrealistic predictions through validation functions
   - It properly handles disconnected graphs with appropriate default values

3. **Consistency Checks**: The `validate_prediction` function ensures predictions are within physically plausible ranges.

4. **Error Bounds**: Our metrics show the model achieves predictions within 1-2 gates of actual depth for most cases.

## Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

#### Feature Extraction:
- **Regex Pattern Matching**: O(n) where n is the size of the RTL code
- **Graph Construction**: O(e) where e is the number of signal dependencies 
- **Graph Analysis**: 
  - Path Analysis: O(V + E) where V is the number of signals and E is the number of dependencies
  - Centrality Calculation: O(V^2) in the worst case

#### Model Training:
- **Random Forest**: O(n_trees * n_samples * log(n_samples) * n_features)
- **Gradient Boosting**: O(n_trees * n_samples * n_features)
- **Neural Networks**: O(epochs * n_samples * n_features * n_neurons)

#### Prediction:
- Feature Extraction: Same as above
- Model Inference: 
  - Tree-based models: O(depth_of_trees * n_trees)
  - Neural Networks: O(n_neurons)

### Space Complexity

- **Feature Storage**: O(n_samples * n_features)
- **Graph Representation**: O(V + E) for adjacency list
- **Model Storage**:
  - Random Forest: O(n_trees * depth_of_trees)
  - Neural Networks: O(n_neurons * n_layers)

### Optimization Techniques

1. Early stopping in deep learning to prevent overfitting
2. Feature importance analysis to identify and potentially eliminate irrelevant features
3. Caching of intermediate results during feature extraction
4. Efficient graph algorithms for dependency analysis

### Additional Information

#### Input Format

The RTL code should be provided as Verilog files. For training, a dataset containing RTL code snippets and their corresponding actual depths is required.

#### Output Format

The predictor returns:
- Predicted combinational depth (in gate levels)
- Confidence metrics
- Visualization of key features and their importance

#### Parameters

- `model_type`: Type of model to use ('random_forest', 'gradient_boosting', 'neural_net', 'deep_net')
- `deep_learning_params`: Configuration for deep learning models (epochs, learning rate, etc.)

#### Limitations

- The predictor works best on synthesizable RTL code
- Very complex arithmetic expressions may have reduced accuracy
- The current implementation focuses on combinational paths and has limited support for sequential logic analysis
